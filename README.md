This is just a simple show case of the functionality of what is asked in the email, one thing noted is the search module includes an auto-completion feature, so to try the enter key you need to click in the search box to let the component know you are trying to press enter. I figure search by address is difficult without the auto-completion, so I decided to include one the sake of simlicity usage.
